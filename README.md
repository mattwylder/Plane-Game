# Plane-Game
This was originally going to be a galaga clone, but I ran into problems when I tried adding bullets.

I'm working on porting this from C to Assembly.

If you want see the game running, download the executable ROM [plane.gb](https://github.com/mattwylder/Plane-Game/blob/master/plane.gb?raw=true) and open it in a [Gameboy Emulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/).
